# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Objectives
    * How to create an object in JavaScript
    * What this means
    * What undefined means
    * Why the variable type and scope is important
    * What is a closure
    * What is a prototype
    * How to inherit an object from another

# Tasks

1. Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class

2. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class
*The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
*Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
*Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

3. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class
*The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
*Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
*Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
*If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

4. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class
*The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
*Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
*Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
*If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
*Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X

5. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class
*The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
*Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
*Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
*If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
*Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
*Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
*Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

6. Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
*The constructor must take 1 argument: size
*The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())

7. Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:
*You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
*Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
*If c is undefined, use the character X
